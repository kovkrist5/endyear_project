        <b>How to Make Chicken Carbonara Pasta Bake:</b>
        <br>
        Cook the pancetta until lightly browned and crisp, then set aside. <br>
        Boil spaghetti, reserve two cups of pasta water, and set aside. <br>
        Whisk the eggs in a bowl, then whisk in 1 ½ cups of the hot pasta water.  <br>
        Whisk in the cheese and cream. <br>
        Add the pasta, pancetta, and chicken to the sauce and toss. <br>
        Transfer the mixture to a prepared baking dish and bake until the sauce is thickened. <br>
        Stir and let stand so the sauce can continue to thicken. Add more pasta water if you like. <br>
        Garnish with parsley and Parmesan cheese. <br>
